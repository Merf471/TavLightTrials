TavernLight questions to fulfill for application purposes

Q1-4 were completed and submitted with no issue.

Q5-7 were unable to be submitted in any meaningful way due to issues logging into TFS after setting up the codebases, database, and server/ip changer (as the site and exterior sources recommended). The server ran and read the database, and I was even prompted to sign in, however no login attempts were successful and I could find no solution.

I did not feel confident submitting guesswork code without the ability to test without any functional tests or video proof, and unfortunately no longer have time to keep attempting fixes.
